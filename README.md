# Stop and Search Queries

A small static site over New Orleans' public
[Stop and Search (Field Interviews)](https://data.nola.gov/d/nfft-hjwi) dataset,
showing how many traffic stops were recorded in a date range, where in the city
they happened, and which vehicle makes and models turn up in them.

| `npm run build`        | Bake, typecheck, then build to `dist/`                 |
| `npm run build:nobake` | Build without re-baking (CI bakes as its own step)     |

## How the data works

The dataset holds ~440,000 traffic-violation records, with events spanning
1991 to November 2025. Aggregation happens **server-side** via SoQL: the app asks
Socrata for `count(*)` and for counts grouped by `vehiclemake, vehiclemodel`,
rather than downloading rows and counting them locally.

There are two paths to a number on the page:

1. **The default range** (the month containing the newest event) is read from
   `public/data/snapshot.json`, produced at build time by
   `scripts/bake-data.mjs`. First paint needs no API request at all.
2. **Any other range** the user picks is queried live from the browser — three
   requests in parallel, for the total, the vehicle breakdown and the map. They
   share one abort signal, so a slow earlier response cannot land after a faster
   later one.

The map aggregates the same way. Stops are grouped by coordinate server-side, so
a month arrives as ~170 rows rather than ~350, and each circle's area is
proportional to the stops recorded at that point.

Coordinates are a partial record and the page says so. Around 63% of
traffic-violation rows carry a placeholder `0, 0` instead of a location, because
the dataset only began recording coordinates in 2018; those rows are filtered out
in the query. Positions are also snapped to the nearest intersection or block
rather than an exact address, which is why the map aggregates instead of
plotting one pin per stop.

Baking is deliberately non-fatal. If data.nola.gov is unreachable during a
build, the committed snapshot is reused and the build continues with a warning.
The deploy workflow also re-bakes monthly on a schedule, so the published
snapshot keeps up without a code change.

`SOCRATA_APP_TOKEN` is optional in both the script and the app. Socrata app
tokens are rate-limit identifiers rather than credentials, and every query here
works without one.

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` (or `master`) runs `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which
typechecks, tests, bakes, builds, and publishes `dist/` straight to GitHub Pages
as a build artifact.

There is no longer a `gh-pages` branch holding compiled output — Pages reads the
artifact directly. **One-time setup:** in the repository's
_Settings → Pages → Build and deployment_, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.

The site is served from a repository subpath, so the build needs
`BASE_PATH=/stop_and_search/`. The workflow derives this automatically via
`actions/configure-pages`; `npm run dev` and `npm run preview` serve from `/`.

## Notes on the toolchain

`typescript` is held at 6.x because `vue-tsc` cannot run on TypeScript 7: the
TS 7 native compiler removed the `typescript/lib/tsc` entry point and exposes its
API only under `./unstable/*`, which the Volar-based type checkers are still
waiting on. This affects `npm run typecheck` alone — Vite strips types without
checking them, so the shipped bundle is unaffected. Bump to `^7` once `vue-tsc`
supports it.
